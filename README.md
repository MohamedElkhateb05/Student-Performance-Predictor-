A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts student exam scores based on various academic and lifestyle factors using regression techniques.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between student characteristics and their academic performance. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate exam scores based on factors like study hours, attendance, parental involvement, and other relevant features.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables using advanced strategies
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Interactive visualizations and correlation analysis to understand data relationships
- **Multiple Modeling Approaches**: Compared Linear Regression with Polynomial Regression
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple performance metrics and visualization of results
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Plotly and ipywidgets for data exploration

## üìÅ Dataset

**Source**: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)  
**Size**: 6,607 students √ó 20 features  
**Target Variable**: `Exam_Score` (numerical)

**Key Features Include**:
- `Hours_Studied`: Daily study hours
- `Previous_Scores`: Historical academic performance
- `Attendance`: Class attendance percentage
- `Teacher_Quality`: Categorical (Low, Medium, High)
- `Internet_Access`: Binary (Yes/No)
- `Sleep_Hours`: Average nightly sleep
- `Extracurricular_Activities`: Binary (Yes/No)
- And 13+ additional features...

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Implemented "Missing" category strategy for categorical variables
- **Feature Encoding**: Advanced mixed encoding approach:
  - Label Encoding for binary features (Yes/No ‚Üí 1/0)
  - One-Hot Encoding for multi-category features
- **Train-Test Split**: 80-20 split with random state for reproducibility

### Modeling Techniques
1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model
2. **Polynomial Regression**: Degree 2 & 3 for capturing non-linear relationships

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## üìà Results

### Best Performing Model
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (Degree 1)
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.7699
- **MAE**: 0.45 points
- **RMSE**: 1.80 points

### Key Insights
- Previous academic scores are the strongest predictor of exam performance
- Teacher quality shows significant impact on student outcomes
- Study hours have a non-linear relationship with exam scores (diminishing returns)
- The model explains 89% of variance in student exam scores

## üöÄ How to Run
